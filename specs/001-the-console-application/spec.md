# Feature Specification: PhotoTransfer Console Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-console-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the console application (phototransfer), at the user's request, indexes all photos from the current directory and subdirectories, by photo file extension (only the image file type is indexed), by photo file creation date, and storage path in the directory (example of calling phototransfer --index). Writes this information to the metadata file that is stored locally. Then, at the user's request, the image files, based on the information from the metadata file, are transferred to a new directory specified by the user with the designation of the time period that is also specified by the user. The user passes the time period in the format year-month >phototransfer --2012-01 as a flag for the console call. As a result, you will get a new directory with photos in the phototransfer/2012-01 folder. These photos will no longer be in the old directories, they are transferred to the new one."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to organize their photo collection by date periods. They need to first index all photos in their current directory structure to create a metadata catalog, then transfer photos from specific time periods to organized directories while removing them from their original locations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a directory structure containing image files, **When** user runs `phototransfer --index`, **Then** all image files are catalogued with creation dates and paths in a local metadata file
2. **Given** an existing metadata file with indexed photos, **When** user runs `phototransfer --2012-01`, **Then** all photos from January 2012 are moved to `phototransfer/2012-01/` directory
3. **Given** photos have been transferred to a date-specific directory, **When** the transfer completes, **Then** the photos are no longer present in their original locations

### Edge Cases
- What happens when photos have no creation date metadata?
- How does the system handle duplicate photos in the same time period?
- What occurs when the target directory already exists and contains files?
- How are non-image files in subdirectories handled during indexing?
- What happens when metadata file becomes corrupted or is deleted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST scan current directory and all subdirectories for image files when `--index` flag is used
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify image files by file extension [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific image extensions are supported - jpg, png, gif, etc?]
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract creation date from image file metadata during indexing
- **FR-004**: System MUST store file path, creation date, and extension data in a local metadata file
- **FR-005**: System MUST accept year-month format (YYYY-MM) as command line argument for photo transfer
- **FR-006**: System MUST create target directory structure `phototransfer/YYYY-MM/` for photo transfer
- **FR-007**: System MUST move (not copy) photos matching the specified time period to target directory
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle photos without creation date metadata [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how should undated photos be processed - skip, prompt user, or use file system date?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent data loss during transfer operations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what happens if target directory already contains files with same names?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Photo File**: Represents an image file with attributes including file path, creation date, file extension, and file size
- **Metadata Record**: Represents indexed information about a photo including original location, creation date, and current status
- **Transfer Operation**: Represents a batch move operation for photos matching a specific time period with source and destination paths
- **Time Period**: Represents a year-month combination used for organizing and filtering photos
